## Reproduce simulation runs

Use the NetLogo model (ProtestFate.nlogo). 

Simulations should preferable be run in NetLogo 6.0.4. (Download free https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

Click the buttons "Example Iran" and "Example Germany" to reproduce the simulations on which Figures 5 and 6 are based. 
Run the other example buttons to check how the scenarion changes as outlined in the text. 

ProtestFate.nlogo also includes the BehviorSpace configuration to produce data for the Parameter Study in Figure 7. The data used for the Figure 7 is also stored in the folder data. The R code to produce the Figure is in Fig7.R.
